P2000 Tape converter

To convert your P2000 tapes, do the following:
- Run SERIAL.BAS on your P2000. This will send all bytes of one side of a tape
  through the P2000's serial port, at a baudrate of 2400Bd with 1 startbit 
  and 1 stopbit
- Run splitape.exe to split the tape .cas file into individual programs
